 This repo contains four items:
 
 -- README.md: The file you are now reading (explaining how the files in this repo work 
      and how they are connected).
 -- Dataset of Averages (Tidy).csv: A tidy dataset, which is a transformation of Version 1.0
      of the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset. It contains averages of 
      the standard deviation and mean variables for each subject/activity/measurement of that
      dataset.
 -- run_analysis.R: A script that creates the dataset described in the previous item; it assumes
      that the working directory is the directory with the original (Version 1.0) dataset. Please
      see comments in the script for more detail on transformations performed.
 -- CodeBook.md: A codebook for the dataset, describing the variables in the dataset.
